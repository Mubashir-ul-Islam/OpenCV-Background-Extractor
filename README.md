# Background Learner Using OpenCV & Python


This program takes an input video of a street and tries to extract the background. Using the OpenCV's averaging tools, and a regulation speed of 0.005, we were able to extract the background in a good. Notice that the street was not completely empty of cars at any frame.

## Requirements
`Python 2 or 3`\
`OpenCV 3.4`\
`Numpy`

## How to start
Run BG_Learner.py, make sure that 'Sample.mp4' is in the same directory as the Python File. A JPG image will be generated at the end.
